Sodoku Solver - Road Map

1. Backend Development (Python)
Sudoku Solver Algorithm: Implement an algorithm in Python to solve Sudoku puzzles. The most common approach is using backtracking, a form of recursion.
Multiple Solutions Detection: Enhance the solver to check if more than one solution exists. This involves modifying the algorithm to continue searching for solutions after finding the first one.
Unsolvable Puzzle Detection: Your algorithm should also be able to detect if a puzzle is unsolvable.
2. User Interface
Web Frontend: Develop a user-friendly interface where users can input Sudoku puzzles. This can be a grid of input boxes corresponding to the Sudoku board.
Interactive Features:
Solve Button: On clicking, it sends the puzzle to the backend for solving.
Hint Button: Provides the next logical number without fully solving the puzzle.
Display Multiple Solutions: If applicable, show alternative solutions.
Error Handling: Inform the user if the puzzle is unsolvable.
3. Integration and Communication
API Development: Create RESTful APIs using a framework like Flask or Django for the frontend to communicate with the Python backend.
Data Format: Use JSON to exchange data (puzzle and solution) between the frontend and backend.
4. Hosting and Deployment
Web Hosting: Choose a hosting service to deploy your web app. Popular choices include AWS, Heroku, and Google Cloud.
Domain Name: Consider purchasing a domain name for a more professional look.
5. Additional Features and Considerations
Responsive Design: Ensure your web app is mobile-friendly.
Security: Implement security best practices, especially if you plan to collect user data.
Testing: Thoroughly test the application for different Sudoku puzzles, including edge cases.

Tools and Technologies
Backend: Python (with Flask or Django)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (consider frameworks like React or Angular for a more dynamic UI)
Database (If needed): For storing puzzles or user data (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management
Deployment: Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud

Development Steps:
Algorithm Implementation: Start by developing the Sudoku solving algorithm in Python.
Backend Setup: Set up the Flask or Django project.
Frontend Development: Create the Sudoku board UI and other interactive elements.
API Integration: Ensure the frontend and backend can communicate effectively.
Testing and Debugging: Test the application extensively to ensure it works correctly.
Deployment: Deploy your application to a web server.
Feedback and Iteration: After deployment, gather user feedback for future improvements.
